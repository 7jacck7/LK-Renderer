# LK-Renderer
We are proud to present you an alternate Renderer for Blender.
It basiclly works the same way rendering does in the usual blender programm but it doesnt displays your render “live” wich ,maybe, result in a faster render.

How it works:
You select a blender version of your choice wich you like(ideally the one you made your .blend with) then you download it once (you dont have to download it again later) select your .blend file choose between an animation or single frame render and hit render. after that a window will pop wich renders the image(s) and there you go!
